1. Log into cassandra machine
2. Inspect the container of cassandra and find the location of the directory of the keyspaces:
    * docker inspect cassandra (take dir from "Mounts/Source")
    * sude -s (for root)
    * cd cassandra dir(from "Mount") then cd data and see if you are in the correct dir
3.0 If you want to check the size of the keyspace
    * du -hs <keyspace> (disk usage human readable summary)
3.1 Archive the keyspaces
    * tar zcf /home/r2d2/randomNameOfTheAchive.tgz [keyspace(which is the dir name)] (z - zip, c - create, f - file)
3.2 Download/Copy the archive to the destination machine
    * scp r2d2@ipOfTheMachine:randomNameOfTheAchive.tgz . (secure copy from source to destination, the dot is the current dir)
4. Copy keyspace and table schema
    * docker exec -it cassandra bash (enter source cassandra container)
    * cqlsh (enters cql syntax)
    * DESCRIBE KEYSPACE <keyspace>; (and copy the schema of keyspace and tables which you need)
    * Enters the destination cassandra and exec the cqls (in order to create the schemas)
5. Extract the files from the zip
    * tar zxf randomNameOfTheAchive.tgz (extract the content of the zip in the current dir)
6. Move the extracted files from the dir of the table into the local cassandra dir
    * install mc or be a loser
7 Enter the local cassandra container and Nodetool import 
    * docker exec -it cassandra bash
    * nodetool import [keyspace] [table_name] [path_to_SSTable_file]
    --- Done ---

Optional steps(better do them)
8. Clean up the archive from the source and destination cassandra
8.1 Source
    *  cd /home/r2d2/
    *  rm randomNameOfTheAchive.tgz
8.2 Local
    * locate and delete the files wherever they are
